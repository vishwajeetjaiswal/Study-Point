			<h2>Object-Oriented Programming Using C++</h2>
				<p>The “object approach”, which is the fundamental idea in the conception of C++programs, consists of building the program as an interaction between objects:<br>1. In all part of the program that use a given object, it is defined by themethodsyou can use on it ;<br>2. you can take an existing object type (called aclass) and add to it dataand methods to manipulate it.</p>
			<p>The gains of such an approach are:<br>1. Modularity : each object has a clear semantic (EmployerorDrawingDevice),a clear set of methods (getSalary(), getAge(), ordrawLine(), drawCircle().<br>2. Less bugs : the data are accessed through the methods and you can usethem only the way to object’s creator wants you to.<br>3. Reutilisability : you can extend an existing object, or you can build a newone which could be used in place of the first one, as long as it has all themethods required (for example theEmployercould be either the CEO ora worker, both of them having the required methods but different dataassociated to them,DrawingDevicecould either be a window, a printer,or anything else).</p>

			<h2>Shell and basic C++</h2>
				<p><strong>GNU/Linux</strong><br><br><b>What is Linux</b><br>1. A big piece of software called the kernel which run as soon as you turnon a Linux computer, and is able to deal with all devices (harddisk,keyboard, mouse, network cards, etc.)<br>2.X-Window, which controls the graphical display ;<br>3. a large list of programs that allow you to edit texts, manage your files,compile source codes, do network administration, etc.<br>The main goal of this course is to learn C++, not to go into the specificitiesof neither Linux or X-Window. We will focus on standard C++ which can beused on other operating systems (Windows, MacOS, BeOS, etc.)</p>

			<h2>First steps in C++<h2></h2><b>Data types</b><br>We can manipulate in C++ programs two different categories of types :<br>•Built-in types which are defined in the C++ compiler itself ;<br>•Class typewhich are defined in C++ source code from the built-in types</p>
